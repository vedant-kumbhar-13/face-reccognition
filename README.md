# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This project implements a face recognition system using a Jupyter Notebook. It likely utilizes deep learning models or OpenCV-based techniques to detect and recognize faces from images or video streams.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV 
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- dlib 
- face\_recognition 
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

To install the necessary dependencies, use:

bash
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras dlib face_recognition matplotlib


## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook face recognition.ipynb
   
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to execute the face recognition pipeline.
3. Upload images or provide a video feed for face detection and recognition.
4. Adjust parameters as needed for improved accuracy.

## Features

- Face detection using OpenCV Haar cascades or deep learning models.
- Face recognition using pre-trained models or custom-trained datasets.
- Image or video stream processing.
- Visualization of detected and recognized faces.

## Notes

- Ensure that your webcam is accessible if the project uses real-time face recognition.
- The accuracy of recognition depends on the dataset and the model used.
- If using deep learning, a GPU is recommended for faster processing.
